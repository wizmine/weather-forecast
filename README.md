# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### API_KEY

Important!

The key for the API is located in redux/slices/weather.ts
I specifically did not put it in .env for your convenience!

### Location

For the application to work correctly, you need to provide access to your location in your browser, it will be loaded in the application and show you the latest information, otherwise the application will not work!
